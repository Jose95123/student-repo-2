# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This collection of process documents explains how we plan, execute, and continuously improve the delivery of product features and services.

OctoAcme follows a clear, phase-based workflow that guides projects from a concise initiation through planning, execution, release, and closure. Projects begin with a Project Charter or one‑pager that captures the problem statement, stakeholders, high‑level timeline and success measures. During planning the team defines scope, resources, milestones, dependencies and a roadmap/release plan; work is broken down into sprint/iteration backlogs with explicit acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done. Execution emphasizes iterative delivery of small, testable increments with regular build/test/review cycles, followed by release activities (deploy, verify, announce) and a formal close that includes retrospectives and action items to drive continuous improvement.

Roles and personas are explicitly defined to maintain accountability and alignment. A named Project Manager coordinates delivery, schedule, risk, and communications while a Product Manager/Product Lead owns outcomes, backlog prioritization, and success measurement. Developers implement features with attention to testability and collaboration, QA/testing teams validate quality against acceptance criteria, and stakeholders provide input and approvals. The docs reference role‑specific artifacts and responsibilities (e.g., who maintains the charter, who updates the risk register) to make ownership and handoffs explicit.

Communication at OctoAcme is structured and cadence‑driven to keep work visible and decisions timely. Regular touchpoints include weekly PM + PdM syncs to align on priorities and risks, twice‑weekly (or agreed) standups for the delivery team, and monthly stakeholder updates for broader transparency. Quality assurance is integrated into each phase: acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done drive development and testing, QA validates acceptance criteria during iterations, and retrospectives capture defects and improvement items that feed back into planning to raise long‑term delivery quality.
